# Axie Infinity Discord Bot (NMC)

## Overview
[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a blockchain-based digital pet universe where players collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.

The Axie Infinity Discord Bot is a tool designed for managing users & managers for an Axie Infinity guild - Nox Moon Cardinal (NMC). This bot provides a sets of commands tailored to Axie Infinity players, enabling them to easily access information related to their Axies, Matchmaking Rating (MMR), Smooth Love Potion amount (SLP), marketplace links (and more!) directly within the Discord server.

## Usage
Simply type the desired command in the Discord server's chat and the bot will respond accordingly with the requested information! Note that some 

## Motivation
This discord bot stemmed from the necessity to better manage players within the guild. As avid players ourselves, we recognised the importance of providing a seamless experience for our community members (players & managers alike) to access relevant information & foster a sense of community within our server! We aimed to straemline processes, tracked performance, promote healthy competition & ultimately enhance everyone's experience! üçª

## Future Enhancements

üë• **Database & Backend**: Setup database & backend server for security reasons to safeguard user & wallet data, role-based access controls & data protection regulations

üìà **Scalability**: Optimize bot's architecture & hosting infrastructure (moving away from replit) to accomodate increased demand for resources. This will benefit when we start opening our bot for all other Axie Infinity gaming guilds to use our bot.
